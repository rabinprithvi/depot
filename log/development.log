 This book is a recipe-based approach to using Subversion that will 
 get you up and running quickly---and correctly. All projects need
 version control: it''s a foundational piece of any project''s

 any version control at all. Many others don''t use it well, and end

 Pragmatic programmers use feedback to drive their development and 
 personal processes. The most valuable feedback you can get while 
 coding comes from unit testing.
 </p>
 <p>
 Without good tests in place, coding can become a frustrating game of 
 "whack-a-mole." That''s the carnival game where the player strikes at a 
 mechanical mole; it retreats and another mole pops up on the opposite side 
 of the field. The moles pop up and down so fast that you end up flailing 
 your mallet helplessly as the moles continue to pop up where you least 
 expect them.
